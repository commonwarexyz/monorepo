//! An _Any_ authenticated database (ADB) provides succinct proofs of _any_ value ever associated
//! with a key. Its implementation is based on an [Mmr] over a log of state-change operations backed
//! by a [Journal].
//!
//! In an Any db, it is not possible to prove whether the value of a key is the currently active
//! one, only that it was associated with the key at some point in the past. This type of
//! authenticated database is most useful for applications involving keys that are given values once
//! and cannot be updated after.
