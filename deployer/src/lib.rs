//! Deploy infrastructure across cloud providers.
//!
//! `commonware-deployer` automates the deployment of infrastructure across different cloud providers, closing the gap
//! between a local demo and remote deployment. `commonware-deployer` is both available as a CLI tool for standard
//! operation and as a library for custom workflows.
//!
//! # CLI Installation
//!
//! ## Local
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo install --path . --force

//! ```
//!
//! # CLI Commands
//!

//!
//! ## `ec2`
//!
//! Deploy a custom binary (and configuration) to any number of EC2 instances across multiple regions. Collect
//! metrics and logs from all instances via a private network.
