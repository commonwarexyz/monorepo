//! Communicate with an authenticated peer over an encrypted connection.
//!
//! This module provides a lightweight, self-contained transport layer for systems where peers
//! already know one another's cryptographic identities (any [commonware_cryptography::Signer]).
//! It offers mutual authentication and encrypted communication using a simplified handshake,
//! eliminating the need for complex protocols like TLS or X.509 certificates. The implementation
//! uses a fixed, non-negotiable cryptographic protocol to simplify implementation and reduce
//! overhead, resulting in a minimal performance impact.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! ## Handshake
//!
//! A three-message handshake is used to authenticate peers and establish a shared secret. The
//! **dialer** initiates the connection, and the **listener** responds.
//!
//! The **dialer** initiates the connection to a known peer identity, while the **listener** accepts
//! incoming connections. Much like a SYN / SYN-ACK / ACK handshake, the dialer and listener
//! exchange messages in three rounds.
//!
//! The SYN-equivalent is a [handshake::Hello] message that contains:
//! - The listener's expected public key (prevents wrong-target attacks)
//! - The dialer's ephemeral public key (for Diffie-Hellman key exchange)
//! - The current timestamp (prevents replay attacks)
//! - The dialer's static public key and signature
//!
//! The ACK-equivalent is a [handshake::Confirmation] message that proves that each party can derive
//! the correct shared secret.
//!
//! Thus:
//! - Message 1 is a `Hello` message from the dialer to the listener
//! - Message 2 is a `Hello` (with a continuation tag) and `Confirmation` message from the listener to the dialer
//! - Message 3 is a `Confirmation` message from the dialer to the listener
//!
//! _The continuation tag binds the listener's [handshake::Hello] response to a particular dialer's
//! [handshake::Hello] message, preventing exfiltration to a different session._
//!
//! ## Encryption
//!
//! All traffic is encrypted using ChaCha20-Poly1305. A shared secret is established using an
//! ephemeral X25519 Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This secret, combined with the handshake
//! transcript, is used to derive keys for both the handshake's key confirmation messages and
//! the post-handshake data traffic. Binding the derived keys to the handshake transcript prevents
//! man-in-the-middle and transcript substitution attacks.
//!
//! Each directional cipher uses a 12-byte nonce derived from a counter that is incremented for each
//! message sent. This counter has sufficient cardinality for over 2.5 trillion years of continuous
//! communication at a rate of 1 billion messages per secondâ€”sufficient for all practical use cases.
//! This ensures that well-behaving peers can remain connected indefinitely as long as they both
//! remain online (maximizing p2p network stability). In the unlikely case of counter overflow, the
//! connection will be terminated and a new connection should be established. This method prevents
//! nonce reuse (which would compromise message confidentiality) while saving bandwidth (as there is
//! no need to transmit nonces explicitly).
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! ## Requirements
//!
//! - **Pre-Shared Namespace**: Peers must agree on a unique, application-specific namespace
//!   out-of-band to prevent cross-application replay attacks.
//! - **Time Synchronization**: Peer clocks must be synchronized to within the `synchrony_bound`
//!   to correctly validate timestamps.
//!
//! ## Provided
//!
//! - **Mutual Authentication**: Both parties prove ownership of their static private keys through
//!   signatures.
//! - **Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral encryption keys ensure that any compromise of long-term static keys
//!   doesn't expose the contents of previous sessions.
//! - **Session Uniqueness**: A listener's [handshake::Hello] is bound to the dialer's [handshake::Hello] message and
//!   [handshake::Confirmation]s are bound to the complete handshake transcript, preventing replay attacks and ensuring
//!   message integrity.
//! - **Handshake Timeout**: A configurable deadline is enforced for handshake completion to protect
//!   against malicious peers that create connections but abandon handshakes.
//!
//! ## Not Provided
//!
//! - **Anonymity**: Peer identities are not hidden during handshakes from network observers (both active
//!   and passive).
//! - **Padding**: Messages are encrypted as-is, allowing an attacker to perform traffic analysis.
//! - **Future Secrecy**: If a peer's static private key is compromised, future sessions will be exposed.
//! - **0-RTT**: The protocol does not support 0-RTT handshakes (resumed sessions).
