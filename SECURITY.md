# Reporting Security Issues

We welcome security disclosures and are committed to providing prompt attention to any confirmed security issues.

Vulnerabilities should be reported privately [via GitHub Security](https://github.com/commonwarexyz/monorepo/security) instead of as a public issue.

We do not yet offer a bounty program for responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities, however, we do track contributions and record them on the leaderboard below.
