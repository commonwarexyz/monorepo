# Reporting Security Issues

We welcome security reports and are committed to providing prompt attention to any security issues.

Vulnerabilities should be reported privately [via GitHub Security](https://github.com/commonwarexyz/monorepo/security) instead of the public issue tracker.

We do not yet offer a bounty program for responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities, however, we do track meaningful contributors and record them on the leaderboard below.
