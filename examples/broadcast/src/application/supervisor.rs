// This file previously contained a Supervisor for consensus-specific logic.
// That Supervisor has been removed as it's not applicable to the current
// broadcast example.

// If the broadcast application evolves to require its own supervisor
// (e.g., for managing multiple ApplicationActor instances, handling specific
// application-level events, or other coordination tasks),
// a new Supervisor struct and related logic could be defined here.

// For now, this file is a placeholder.
// No supervisor is actively used by the simplified broadcast example.

// Example of a potential future supervisor struct:
/*
use super::ingress::ActorMailbox; // Or other relevant types
use commonware_runtime::Spawner;
use futures::channel::mpsc;
use tracing::info;

pub struct BroadcastApplicationSupervisor<R: Spawner> {
    context: R,
    // Example: mailboxes to different actors it might manage
    // actor_mailboxes: Vec<ActorMailbox>,
}

impl<R: Spawner> BroadcastApplicationSupervisor<R> {
    pub fn new(context: R) -> Self {
        info!("New BroadcastApplicationSupervisor created (placeholder).");
        Self { context }
    }

    pub async fn run(&mut self) {
        info!("BroadcastApplicationSupervisor run loop started (placeholder).");
        // Supervisor logic would go here
    }
}
*/

// Ensure this file does not cause compilation errors if `application/mod.rs`
// tries to import from it. If `mod.rs` was `pub mod supervisor;` and
// `pub use supervisor::Supervisor;`, then a dummy `Supervisor` might be needed
// or the `pub use` line removed from `mod.rs`.
// For now, keeping it empty and will adjust `mod.rs` as needed.
