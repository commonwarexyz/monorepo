Reshare a threshold secret over an epoched log.

## Setup

_To run this example, you must first install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [`mprocs`](https://github.com/pvolok/mprocs)._

## Usage

First, set up the network participants:

```sh
# Default configuration (4 participants)
cargo run --bin commonware-reshare setup

# With configuration:
cargo run --bin commonware-reshare setup [--num-peers <n>] [--num-bootstrappers <n>] [--datadir <path>] [--base-port <port>]
```

Then, run the `mprocs` command emitted by the setup procedure to start all participants simultaneously.

### Troubleshooting

If you see an error like `unable to append to journal: Runtime(BlobOpenFailed("engine-consensus", "00000000000000ee", Os { code: 24, kind: Uncategorized, message: "Too many open files" }))`,
you may need to increase the maximum number of open files. You can do this by running:

```bash
ulimit -n 65536
```

_MacOS defaults to 256 open files, which is too low for the default settings (where 1 journal file is maintained per recent view)._
