/// A one-time broadcast that can be awaited by many tasks. It is often used for
/// coordinating shutdown across many tasks.
///
/// Each [Signal] tracks its lifecycle to enable proper shutdown coordination.
/// To minimize overhead, it is recommended to wait on a reference to it
/// (i.e. `&mut signal`) in loops rather than creating multiple `Signal`s.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ## Basic Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// use commonware_runtime::{Spawner, Runner, deterministic, signal::Signaler};
///
/// let executor = deterministic::Runner::default();
/// executor.start(|context| async move {
///     // Setup signaler and get future
///     let (signaler, signal) = Signaler::new();
///
///     // Signal shutdown
///     signaler.signal(2);
///
///     // Wait for shutdown in task
///     let sig = signal.await.unwrap();
///     println!("Received signal: {}", sig);
/// });
/// ```
///
/// ## Advanced Usage
///
/// While `Futures::Shared` is efficient, there is still meaningful overhead
/// to cloning it (i.e. in each iteration of a loop). To avoid
/// a performance regression from introducing `Signaler`, it is recommended
/// to wait on a reference to `Signal` (i.e. `&mut signal`).
///
/// ```rust
/// use commonware_macros::select;
/// use commonware_runtime::{Clock, Spawner, Runner, deterministic, Metrics, signal::Signaler};
/// use futures::channel::oneshot;
/// use std::time::Duration;
///
/// let executor = deterministic::Runner::default();
/// executor.start(|context| async move {
///     // Setup signaler and get future
///     let (signaler, mut signal) = Signaler::new();
///
///     // Loop on the signal until resolved
///     let (tx, rx) = oneshot::channel();
///     context.with_label("waiter").spawn(|context| async move {
///         loop {
///             // Wait for signal or sleep
///             select! {
///                  sig = &mut signal => {
///                      println!("Received signal: {}", sig.unwrap());
///                      break;
///                  },
///                  _ = context.sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)) => {},
///             };
///         }
///         let _ = tx.send(());
///     });
///
///     // Send signal
///     signaler.signal(9);
///
///     // Wait for task
///     rx.await.expect("shutdown signaled");
/// });
