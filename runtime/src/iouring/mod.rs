//! Asynchronous io_uring event loop implementation.
//!
//! This module provides a high-level interface for submitting operations to Linux's io_uring
//! subsystem and receiving their results asynchronously. The design centers around a single
//! event loop that manages the submission queue (SQ) and completion queue (CQ) of an io_uring
//! instance.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ## Event Loop
//!
//! The core of this implementation is the [run] function, which operates an event loop that:
//! 1. Receives operation requests via an MPSC channel
//! 2. Assigns unique IDs to each operation and submits them to io_uring's submission queue (SQE)
//! 3. Polls io_uring's completion queue (CQE) for completed operations
//! 4. Routes completion results back to the original requesters via oneshot channels
//!
//! ## Operation Flow
//!
//! ```text
//! Client Code ─[Op]→ MPSC Channel ─→ Event Loop ─[SQE]→ io_uring Kernel
//!      ↑                                                 ↓
//! Oneshot Channel ←─ Waiter Tracking ←[CQE]─ io_uring Kernel
//! ```
//!
//! ## Work Tracking
//!
//! Each submitted operation is assigned a unique work ID that serves as the `user_data` field
//! in the SQE. The event loop maintains a `waiters` HashMap that maps each work ID to:
//! - A oneshot sender for returning results to the caller
//! - An optional buffer that must be kept alive for the duration of the operation
//!
//! ## Timeout Handling
//!
//! Operations can be configured with timeouts using `Config::op_timeout`. When enabled:
//! - Each operation is linked to a timeout using io_uring's `IOSQE_IO_LINK` flag
//! - If the timeout fires first, the operation is canceled and returns `ETIMEDOUT`
//! - Reserved work IDs distinguish timeout completions from regular operations
//!
//! ## Deadlock Prevention
//!
//! The [Config::force_poll] option prevents deadlocks in scenarios where:
//! - Multiple tasks use the same io_uring instance
//! - One task's completion depends on another task's submission
//! - The event loop is blocked waiting for completions and can't process new submissions
//!
//! When enabled, the event loop periodically wakes up to check for new work, ensuring
//! forward progress even when no completions are immediately available.
//!
//! ## Shutdown Process
//!
//! When the operation channel closes, the event loop enters a drain phase:
//! 1. Stops accepting new operations
//! 2. Waits for all in-flight operations to complete
//! 3. If `shutdown_timeout` is configured, abandons remaining operations after the timeout
//! 4. Cleans up and exits
