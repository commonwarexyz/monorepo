        <p>While proving you had a lot of money at some time in the past might go over well at a party, what's often far more useful is proving how much money you have <i>right now</i>. In database terms, this comes down to proving the <i>current state</i> of a key in a database, which is what we take on in this third article from our series on applying the Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) for efficient data authentication.</p>
        <p>Recall that our <a href="https://commonware.xyz/blogs/mmr.html">first article</a> described the basics of the MMR and what makes it special: updates are <i>fast</i> (compared to a more standard Merkle Tree) because they only append new data without modifying any historical data. Our <a href="https://commonware.xyz/blogs/adb-any.html">second article</a> described how one might use an MMR to authenticate the simplest database you need for state sync and interoperability, even though at first glance the MMR might appear inapplicable to the task. The idea here was to view a database as the result of applying a sequential list of operations, over which the MMR is then constructed. We called this structure <i>adb::any</i> because it allows for a compact proof (from an untrusted server, of course) that a specific key had taken on <i>any one</i> of its historical values at some point in its history.</p>
