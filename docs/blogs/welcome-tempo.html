        <h1>Welcome, Tempo</h1>
        <div class="meta">

            <div class="date">November 7, 2025</div>

        <p>
            Today, we're thrilled to share that <a href="https://tempo.xyz">Tempo</a> is building with the <a href="https://github.com/commonwarexyz/monorepo">Commonware Library</a>, supporting our growth as a new core contributor, and accelerating our research and engineering with a strategic investment.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started Commonware because I believe that <a href="/blogs/introducing-commonware.html">the best onchain experiences will develop a sustained edge through specialization</a> and <a href="/blogs/commonware-the-anti-framework.html">the one-size-fits-all frameworks available today</a> prevent ambitious teams from doing exactly this. Rather than prioritizing balanced performance and functionality across all applications, the Commonware Library provides a collection of standalone primitives across network, storage, and consensus that can be remixed as engineers see fit.
        </p>

            <div class="image-caption">
                The Commonware Library has no explicit layering or hierarchy. No specific security assumption. No hardcoded block format, state layout, definition of finality, mempool policy, execution rules, nor fee metering.

        <p>
            It should be no surprise then that collaborating with Tempo, “the blockchain designed for payments,” made a lot of sense. Tempo is directing their research towards mechanisms that unlock differentiated payment experiences and Commonware is supplying state-of-the-art primitives for everything else. When live, Commonware will collect invaluable telemetry from real-world environments to improve the Commonware Library for all other users.
        </p>
        <p>
            To accelerate Commonware's work to make (wicked good) blockchain infrastructure accessible to all developers, Tempo is both supporting the Commonware Library as a core contributor and leading a $25M strategic investment into Commonware. We look forward to collaborating with Tempo and releasing hundreds of new and free primitives in the years to come. Read more <a href="https://tempo.xyz/commonware">here</a>.
