        <h1>Reducing Block Time (and Resource Usage) with Buffered Signatures</h1>
        <div class="meta">
            <div class="author">By <a href="https://x.com/_patrickogrady">Patrick O'Grady</a></div>
            <div class="date">May 28, 2025</div>
        </div>
        <p>A few months ago, we launched <a href="https://x.com/_patrickogrady/status/1901645720823935341">Alto</a>, a minimal (and wicked fast) blockchain for continuously benchmarking the <a href="https://github.com/commonwarexyz/monorepo">Commonware Library</a>. Today, I'm thrilled <a href="https://alto.commonware.xyz">to share</a> that this benchmarking drove a 20% reduction in block time (to ~200ms), a 20% reduction in block finality (to ~300ms), a 65% reduction in CPU usage, and a 27% reduction in bandwidth usage.</p>
        <p>It turns out procrastinating (or buffering) can indeed be a great strategy.</p>
        <h2>The Road to 200ms</h2>
        <p><a href="https://commonware.xyz/blogs/introducing-commonware.html">Last August</a>, we released the first <a href="https://github.com/commonwarexyz/monorepo">Commonware Library</a> primitive: <a href="https://docs.rs/commonware-p2p/latest/commonware_p2p/authenticated/index.html">p2p::authenticated</a>. Unlike traditional p2p libraries that focus on gossip-based messaging over a subset of randomly connected peers, <i>p2p::authenticated</i> provides point-to-point communication between fully-connected peers (where each connection is authenticated by a previously known public key, like the one a validator registered when staking).</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="../imgs/gossip-models.png" alt="Comparing gossip models">
            <div class="image-caption">Figure 1: Comparing gossip models</div>
        </div>
        <p>The consensus primitives <a href="https://commonware.xyz/blogs/commonware-the-anti-framework.html">we released in December</a> (<a href="https://docs.rs/commonware-consensus/latest/commonware_consensus/simplex/index.html">simplex</a>) and <a href="https://commonware.xyz/blogs/threshold-simplex.html">January</a> (<a href="https://docs.rs/commonware-consensus/latest/commonware_consensus/threshold_simplex/index.html">threshold_simplex</a>) built on top of <i>p2p::authenticated</i> but didn't do anything particularly clever with it (the point-to-point messaging alone was enough of an improvement to reach the ~250ms block time in the original Alto launch).</p>
        <p>So, what would something clever look like?</p>
        <h2>Lazy Signature Verification</h2>
        <p>Seeking to progress through consensus as fast as possible, validators typically verify signatures as soon as they receive them (sometimes even in parallel). This eager verification makes intuitive sense—you want to either enter a new view or finalize a block as soon as possible. In fact, doing anything else with a traditional gossip messaging doesn't work.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="../imgs/invalid-signature-gossip.png" alt="Block peers that send invalid signatures">
            <div class="image-caption">Figure 4: Block peers that send invalid signatures</div>
        </div>
        <p>When peers are tasked with forwarding another's messages, the recipient can never be sure what they have until said messages are verified. A malicious peer could forward a message with a valid signature or tamper with it. They could hallucinate a message that a valid peer never sent (with an invalid signature). Or even block valid peers from sending any messages <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/eclipse-attacks-defense-bitcoin">if they eclipse you.</a> If an invalid signature is detected, the best you can do is block the immediate sender (although they can just generate a new identity and try to reconnect to you from a new address).</p>
        <p>With <i>p2p::authenticated</i>, we have the necessary functionality to do something novel: dedicated peer slots. Instead of verifying each signature individually as it arrives, we buffer them in slots dedicated to each registered peer (as each connection is point-to-point and authenticated, there is no way anyone other than said peer could fill this slot). When we collect a quorum (2f+1) of signatures over the same message, we perform a single multi-signature verification (or batch verification in the case of simplex).</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="../imgs/buffering.png" alt="Buffer signatures until a quorum is reached">
            <div class="image-caption">Figure 2: Buffer signatures until a quorum is reached</div>
        </div>
        <h2>Handling Invalid Signatures</h2>
        <p>But wait—what happens when someone sends an invalid signature? If we're batch verifying, doesn't one bad apple spoil the whole bunch?</p>
        <p>Not quite. When a batch verification fails, we perform a binary search over the buffered signatures to identify the culprit. In the worst case (where half the signatures are invalid), this requires O(n log n) individual verifications. But here's the key: Byzantine nodes that send invalid signatures get permanently blocked.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="../imgs/bisection.png" alt="Search for invalid signatures via repeated bisection">
            <div class="image-caption">Figure 3: Search for invalid signatures via repeated bisection</div>
        </div>
        <p>This permanent blocking is another advantage of authenticated connections. In traditional gossip networks, you can't safely block peers for forwarding invalid signatures—they might just be innocent relays of someone else's malicious message. Even if you block them, they can spin up a new identity and continue the attack.</p>
        <p>With <i>p2p::authenticated</i>, identity is tied to consensus participation. Once blocked, a Byzantine node can't reconnect without changing their consensus identity—a much higher bar.</p>
        <h2>The Numbers Don't Lie</h2>
        <p>The results speak for themselves. By moving from ~50 individual signature verifications per view to just 1-2 batch/aggregate verifications, we've transformed the performance profile of consensus:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Block time</b>: 250ms → 200ms (20% reduction)</li>
            <li><b>Finality</b>: 375ms → 300ms (20% reduction)</li>
            <li><b>CPU usage</b>: 26% → 9% on a <a href="https://github.com/commonwarexyz/alto/tree/main/chain#create-artifacts-1">c7g.xlarge</a> (65% reduction)</li>
            <li><b>Bandwidth</b>: 27% reduction through more efficient message handling</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That 9% CPU usage is particularly striking. On a 4-core instance, consensus now consumes less than half a core, leaving 91% of the compute available for your application. This isn't just an optimization—it's a fundamental reframing of what consensus should cost.</p>
        <h2>Consensus as a Sideshow</h2>
        <p>Too often, consensus dominates the resource profile of blockchain applications. Validators spend most of their cycles verifying signatures, gossiping messages, and managing peer connections. The actual application—the thing users care about—gets whatever scraps remain.</p>
        <p>Buffered signatures flip this dynamic. By dramatically reducing the cost of agreement, we free applications to use the resources they're paying for. Whether you're building a high-frequency DEX, a social network, or an onchain game, those extra cores are now yours to use.</p>
        <p>This is what we mean when we say consensus should be a sideshow. The main event is your application. Don't let the infrastructure steal the spotlight.</p>
