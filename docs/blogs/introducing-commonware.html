        <h2>Introducing Commonware</h2>
        <div class="date">October 22, 2023</div>
        <p>Like many of you, I started working in the crypto space because I believe the internet will be a better place if (a lot) more of it is onchain. I am launching a new company, <a href="https://x.com/commonwarexyz">@commonwarexyz</a>, because I think the communities that will lead this transition over the next decade will take a different path than the ones already paved.</p>
        <p>At Commonware, we believe that the best onchain experiences will develop a sustained edge through specialization. Like the Web 2.0 era that came before, we believe unbundling blockchains (tailoring networking, consensus, storage, and execution to amplify the unique aspects of an application) will create a lasting advantage and unlock performance that can rival the centralized websites where most users spend their time.</p>
        <p>To accelerate developers that share this perspective, Commonware is building an open, Rust-based blockchain framework architected for excessive throughput, tractable modification, and embedded interoperability. Handle surging load with Decoupled State Machine Replication (DSMR), inject novel low-level functionality without maintaining a fork, and communicate with external deployments using static identities + efficiently verifiable consensus artifacts.</p>
        <p>Today, we are taking the first step towards launching the Commonware Framework. p2p, our first primitive, is now available (in ALPHA) under both Apache-2 and MIT: https://docs.rs/commonware-p2p.</p>
        <p>See you on GitHub (for now)!</p>
        <p><i>Want to help? Commonware is looking for a small group of founding engineers (1-10% equity). If you enjoy the never-ending challenge of building performant distributed systems, reach out to @commonwarexyz or hiring@commonware.xyz with a link to some of your most interesting work!</i></p>
