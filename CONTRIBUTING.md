# Setting Expectations

External contributors are encouraged to submit issues and pull requests to this repository. That being said, not all issues will be addressed nor pull requests merged (even if well-intentioned).

The Commonware Library provides reliable and high-performance primitives and contributions that do not advance these goals may not be accepted. This could include (but is not limited to) replacing code with external dependencies, implementing optional functionality, and/or introducing algorithms that substantially increase complexity to provide marginal performance improvements. On the other hand, adding more tests and benchmarks is almost always welcome!
