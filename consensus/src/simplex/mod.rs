//! Simple and fast BFT agreement inspired by Simplex Consensus.
//!
//! Inspired by [Simplex Consensus](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/463), `simplex` provides
//! simple and fast BFT agreement that seeks to minimize view latency (i.e. block time)
//! and to provide optimal finalization latency in a partially synchronous setting.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! * Wicked Fast Block Times (2 Network Hops)
//! * Optimal Finalization Latency (3 Network Hops)
//! * Externalized Uptime and Fault Proofs
//! * Decoupled Block Broadcast and Sync
//! * Flexible Block Format
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! All logic is split into two components: the `Voter` and the `Resolver` (and the user of `simplex`
//! provides `Application`). The `Voter` is responsible for participating in the latest view and the
//! `Resolver` is responsible for fetching artifacts from previous views required to verify proposed
//! blocks in the latest view.
//!
//! To provide great performance, all interactions between `Voter`, `Resolver`, and `Application` are
//! non-blocking. This means that, for example, the `Voter` can continue processing messages while the
//! `Application` verifies a proposed block or the `Resolver` verifies a notarization.

//! ```
//!
//! _Application is usually a single object that implements the `Automaton`, `Relay`, `Committer`,
//! and `Supervisor` traits._
//!
//! ## Joining Consensus
//!
//! As soon as `2f+1` votes or finalizes are observed for some view `v`, the `Voter` will enter `v+1`.
//! This means that a new participant joining consensus will immediately jump ahead to the latest view
//! and begin participating in consensus (assuming it can verify blocks).
//!
//! ## Persistence
//!
//! The `Voter` caches all data required to participate in consensus to avoid any disk reads on
//! on the critical path. To enable recovery, the `Voter` writes valid messages it receives from
//! consensus and messages it generates to a write-ahead log (WAL) implemented by [`Journal`](https://docs.rs/commonware-storage/latest/commonware_storage/journal/index.html).
//! Before sending a message, the `Journal` sync is invoked to prevent inadvertent Byzantine behavior
//! on restart (especially in the case of unclean shutdown).
//!
//! ## Protocol Description
//!
//! ### Specification for View `v`
//!
//! Upon entering view `v`:
//! * Determine leader `l` for view `v`
//! * Set timer for leader proposal `t_l` and advance `t_a`
//!     * If leader `l` has not been active (no votes) in last `r` views, set `t_l` to 0.
//! * If leader `l`, broadcast `notarize(c,v)`
//!   * If can't propose container in view `v` because missing notarization/nullification for a
//!     previous view `v_m`, request `v_m`
//!
//! Upon receiving first `notarize(c,v)` from `l`:
//! * Cancel `t_l`
//! * If the container's parent `c_parent` is notarized at `v_parent` and we have null notarizations for all views
//!   between `v` and `v_parent`, verify `c` and broadcast `notarize(c,v)`
//!
//! Upon receiving `2f+1` `notarize(c,v)`:
//! * Cancel `t_a`
//! * Mark `c` as notarized
//! * Broadcast `notarization(c,v)` (even if we have not verified `c`)
//! * If have not broadcast `nullify(v)`, broadcast `finalize(c,v)`
//! * Enter `v+1`
//!
//! Upon receiving `2f+1` `nullify(v)`:
//! * Broadcast `nullification(v)`
//!     * If observe `>= f+1` `notarize(c,v)` for some `c`, request `notarization(c_parent, v_parent)` and any missing
//!       `nullification(*)` between `v_parent` and `v`. If `c_parent` is than last finalized, broadcast last finalization
//!       instead.
//! * Enter `v+1`
//!
//! Upon receiving `2f+1` `finalize(c,v)`:
//! * Mark `c` as finalized (and recursively finalize its parents)
//! * Broadcast `finalization(c,v)` (even if we have not verified `c`)
//!
//! Upon `t_l` or `t_a` firing:
//! * Broadcast `nullify(v)`
//! * Every `t_r` after `nullify(v)` broadcast that we are still in view `v`:
//!    * Rebroadcast `nullify(v)` and either `notarization(v-1)` or `nullification(v-1)`
//!
//! ## Adapting Simplex to Real-World: Syncing, Restarts, and Dropped Messages
//!
//! * Distinct Leader timeout (in addition to notarization timeout)
//!     * Skip leader timeout/notarization timeout if we haven't seen a participant vote in some number of views
//! * Don't assume that all notarizations are sent with each proposal
//! * Backfill containers from notarizing peers rather than passing along with notarization message
//! * Dynamic sync for new nodes (join consensus at tip right away and backfill history + new containers on-the-fly)/no dedicated
//!   "sync" phase
//! * Send indices of public keys rather than public keys themselves
//! * Only multicast proposal `c` in `v` on transition to `v+1  to peers that haven't already voted for `c`
//! * Only multicast dependent notarizations (notarization for `c_parent` and null notarizations between `c_parent` and `c`) for `v` to peers that
//!   didn't vote for `c`
//!
//!
//! # What is a good fit?
//!
//! * Desire fast block times (as fast as possible): No message relay through leader
//!     * Uptime/Fault tracking (over `n` previous heights instead of waiting for some timeout after notarization for
//!       more votes) -> means there is no wait at the end of a view to collect more votes/finalizes
//! * Proposals are small (include references to application data rather than application data itself): Each notarization may require each party to re-broadcast the proposal
//! * Small to medium number of validators (< 500): All messages are broadcast
//! * Strong robustness against Byzantine leaders? (still can trigger later than desired start to verification) but can't force a fetch
//!     * Saves at least 1 RTT (and more if first recipient doesn't have/is byzantine)
//!     * Minimal ability to impact performance in next view (still can timeout current view)
//!     * No requirement for consecutive honest leaders to commit
//!
//! # Tradeoff: Bandwidth Efficiency or Robustness
//!
//! * This is the difference between broadcasting a proposal to the next leader if they didn't vote for the block and waiting for them
//!   to fetch the block themselves.
//!
//! # Performance Degradation
//!
//! * Ever-growing unfinalized tip: processing views are cached in-memory
//!     * Particularly bad if composed of null notarizations
//!
//! Crazy Idea: What if there is no proposal and the vote/notarization contains all info (only ever include a hash of the proposal)? Would this undermine
//! an application's ability to build a useful product (as wouldn't know contents of block until an arbitrary point in the future, potentially after asked to produce
//! a new block/may also not know parent yet)?
//! * Could leave to the builder to decide whether to wait to produce a block until they've seen finalized parent or not. Would anyone ever want not? Could also
//!   leave constructing/disseminating the block to the builder. We agree on hashes, you can do whatever you want to get to that point?
//! * TL;DR: Agreement isn't Dissemination -> Tension: Agreement is most reliable with all-to-all broadcast but dissemnination is definitely not most efficient that way
//! * Verify returns as soon as get the proposal rather than immediately if don't have it. This will ensure that consensus messages that get to participant before payload
//!   won't just immediately be dropped?
