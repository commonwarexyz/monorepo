//! Leader election strategies for simplex consensus.
//!
//! This module provides the [`Config`] and [`Elector`] traits for customizing
//! how leaders are selected for each consensus round, along with built-in implementations.
//!
//! # Built-in Electors
//!
//! - [`RoundRobin`]/[`RoundRobinElector`]: Deterministic rotation through participants
//!   based on view number. Optionally shuffled using a seed. Works with any signing scheme.
//!
//! - [`Random`]/[`RandomElector`]: Uses randomness derived from BLS threshold VRF signatures
//!   for unpredictable leader selection. Falls back to round-robin for the first view
//!   (no certificate available). Requires [`super::scheme::bls12381_threshold::vrf`]
//!   (implements [`super::scheme::bls12381_threshold::vrf::Seedable`]).
//!
//! # Custom Electors
//!
//! Applications can implement [`Config`] and [`Elector`] for custom leader
//! selection logic such as stake-weighted selection or other application-specific strategies.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Users configure leader election with an elector [`Config`] (for example,
//! [`RoundRobin`]) and pass it to the consensus configuration. Consensus builds
//! the initialized [`Elector`] with the scheme participants before starting.

///
/// The `certificate` parameter to [`elect`](Elector::elect) is `None` only for

/// provides the certificate that unlocked the target view. With stable leaders,
/// a nullification certificate can skip to the next term start, so this is not
/// necessarily a certificate from the immediately previous view.
///
/// Whether certificate data is safe to use for leader selection depends on the
/// certificate scheme. Certificates are not necessarily canonical: schemes that
/// retain signer contributions can produce different valid certificates for the
/// same subject from different quorum subsets. Message reordering or a Byzantine
/// participant can therefore cause honest participants to call `elect` for the
/// same round with different certificate values. Implementations must not derive
/// the leader from a certificate's raw encoding or signer set unless the scheme
/// guarantees that the result is invariant across every valid representation.
///
/// Honest participants may also enter the same round with certificates for
/// different subjects (for example, one via a notarization of the previous view
/// and another via a nullification). With `term_length > 1`, those certificates
/// may even be from different views. Implementations must return the same leader
/// for every certificate that can unlock the round. [`RoundRobinElector`] meets
/// this requirement by ignoring the certificate. [`RandomElector`] uses the
/// recovered threshold seed signature, which is independent of vote type and
/// quorum subset for a given round. [`Random`] does not support `term_length > 1`
/// because certificates from different views carry different seed signatures.
