//! The resolver is responsible for ensuring that the voter has all the certificates it needs to
//! make progress. The voter is voting in a view and has a "floor" view which is the latest
//! certified (or finalized) view that it knows about. Thus, it either requires covering
//! nullification evidence for intermediate views, or a higher floor. It will request the required
//! nullifications from the resolver. Other nodes will either serve such nullifications, or higher floors.
//!
//! # Fetch Strategy
//!
//! A nullification covers the view it was created for and the rest of that view's term, and a
//! request only accepts nullifications from its own term (see [`crate::types::View::covers`]).
//! One request per term, at its lowest uncovered view (the term's "anchor"), is therefore
//! sufficient: whatever answers it covers the rest of the term, and a higher floor moots it. The
//! fetch scan requests each term's anchor and advances a cursor past everything it scanned:
//!
//! ```text
//! term:      [1  2  3  4  5] [6 . . . 10] [11 . . . 15]    current = 14
//! request:   [1]             [6]          [11]             cursor -> 16
//!
//! nullification@4 covers 4..=5:  only a request keyed in [4, 5] retrieves it
//! nullification@4 for request 6: rejected (wrong term)
//! ```
//!
//! Requests stay pending in the resolver until answered or retained out, so the cursor never
//! revisits scanned views on its own (a rescan re-issues fetches for requests that are still
//! pending, which the resolver engine deduplicates).
//!
//! # Mid-Term Floor Raises
//!
//! A floor raise landing inside a term (a certified notarization or a finalization at a mid-term
//! view) strands the term's tail: the anchor request is retained out with the floor, requests in
//! later terms reject this term's nullifications, and the cursor is already past it. Nothing
//! would ever re-request the tail, so a validator whose parent chain rests at the floor could
//! never validate proposals that skip it:
//!
//! ```text
//! floor raises to 3, mid-term of [1, 5]:
//!
//! term:      [1  2  3 |  4  5] [6 . . . 10] [11 . . . 15]
//!                     ^floor
//! request:    x          ??    [6]          [11]
//!            (retained out)    (reject term-1 evidence)
//! ```
//!
//! Pruning repairs this by pulling the cursor back to just above the floor, so a later scan
//! re-requests the tail. Anchors whose requests are still pending are re-issued along the way
//! and deduplicated by the engine, while anchors with a stored covering nullification are
//! skipped:
//!
//! ```text
//! pull-back: cursor = min(cursor, floor + 1) = 4
//!
//! next scan: fetch(4), then the later anchors: fetch(6), fetch(11)
//!                                              (still pending: deduplicated)
//!
//! term:      [1  2  3 |  4  5] [6 . . . 10] [11 . . . 15]
//! request:              [4]    [6]          [11]
//! ```
//!
//! With single-view terms every view is its own anchor, a floor raise can never land mid-term,
//! and the pull-back never fires.
