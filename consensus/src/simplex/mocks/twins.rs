//! Twins framework scenario generator and executor helpers.
//!
//! This module follows the testing architecture from
//! [Twins: BFT Systems Made Robust](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10617):
//! 1. Generate primary/secondary recipient-set scenarios.
//! 2. Combine those sets with leader choices per round.
//! 3. Arrange those round choices into full multi-round scenarios.
//! 4. Execute each scenario across compromised-node assignments.
//!
//! The original paper models disjoint network partitions over nodes and their
//! twins. This harness deliberately uses a stronger Simplex-specific
//! recipient-set model: the primary and secondary halves are represented as
//! independent recipient masks, so a participant may be visible to both halves,
//! one half, or neither half in a scripted round. After the scripted prefix,
//! traffic returns to all-to-all synchrony and leader election resumes through
//! the caller's fallback elector.
//!
//! Campaigns are intended to cover small representative Twins schedules rather
//! than production-sized validator sets. Participant sets are capped at 64 so
//! recipient sets and residual cell boundaries can be stored as plain `u64`
//! masks.
//!
//! Scenarios are generated in a canonical unlabeled form instead of by
//! enumerating every participant relabeling. The generator tracks participant
//! symmetry classes as `cells`, where each cell is a group of participants that
//! have been indistinguishable across all attack rounds generated so far.
//! Advancing one round refines those cells by splitting each group according to
//! the role its members take in the new round.
//!
//! ## Algorithm
//!
//! In each round, every non-leader participant belongs to one of four ordered
//! role buckets: outside both halves, visible to both halves, visible only to
//! the secondary half, or visible only to the primary half. The generated
//! leader is a singleton at the end of its cell and must be visible to at least
//! one half; total leader isolation is outside this scenario space.
//!
//! A residual cell is a group of participants with identical role history in
//! the scripted prefix. When a participant leads, it becomes a permanent
//! singleton because future rounds can distinguish it from the other members of
//! its old cell. A transition records only the next residual cell boundaries.
//! For a fixed set of part sizes, multiple role-bucket choices can produce the
//! same next boundaries, so the transition stores their count as
//! `multiplicity`. Scenario counts are computed over this compressed
//! transition DAG, and `round_from_edge` reconstructs sampled rounds by
//! decoding the chosen edge's rank as mixed-radix digits in cell order.
//!
//! For example, with one cell of three participants and leader `2`, a round can
//! split the two non-leaders as `[both = 1, primary-only = 1]` and place the
//! leader in the secondary half. The canonical representative sets primary to
//! `{0, 1}` and secondary to `{0, 2}`, producing residual cells `[1, 1, 1]`.
//! The same part sizes with `both` and `secondary-only` roles instead produce
//! the same residual cells but different masks, so they share the transition
//! target and contribute to its multiplicity.
//!
//! Scenario generation guarantees that every case within a campaign is
//! structurally distinct -- no duplicate (scenario, compromised-assignment)
//! pairs are ever emitted. The scenario space is counted with an exact
//! compressed transition DAG: each edge stores a residual symmetry-cell
//! transition and the exact number of concrete round scenarios represented by
//! that transition. Counts are computed bottom-up over the reachable residual
//! states. When the scenario space exceeds the configured budget, sampled
//! campaigns choose canonical scenarios uniformly without replacement. For
//! each selected scenario, `cases()` computes the residual symmetry cells and
//! generates only the unique compromised-node assignments: two assignments that
//! differ only in which members of a cell are chosen are equivalent and
//! collapsed to a single representative.
//!
//! These recipient sets are not required to be disjoint. A participant may
//! appear in both masks for a round, meaning both twin halves can exchange
//! messages with that participant identity in that view.
