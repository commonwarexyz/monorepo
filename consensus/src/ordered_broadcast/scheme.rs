//! Signing scheme implementations for `ordered_broadcast`.
//!
//! This module provides protocol-specific wrappers around the generic signing schemes
//! in [`commonware_cryptography::certificate`]. Each wrapper binds the scheme's subject type to
//! [`AckSubject`], which is used for signing and verifying chunk acknowledgments.
//!
//! # Available Schemes
//!
//! - [`ed25519`]: Attributable signatures with individual verification. HSM-friendly,
//!   no trusted setup required.
//! - [`bls12381_multisig`]: Attributable signatures with aggregated verification.
//!   Compact certificates while preserving attribution.
//! - [`bls12381_threshold`]: Non-attributable threshold signatures. Constant-size
//!   certificates regardless of committee size.
