//! Authority
//!
//! PoA Consensus useful for running a DKG (round-robin leader selection, update participants with config).
//!
//! All decisions made to minimize container time and finalization latency without sacrificing
//! the ability to attribute uptime and faults.
//!
//! # Externalizable Uptime and Faults
//!
//! Instead of handling uptime and fault tracking internally, the application is notified of all
//! activity and can incorportate such information as needed (into the payload or otherwise).
//!
//! # Sync
//!
//! Wait for container notarization at tip (2f+1), fetch heights backwards (don't
//! need to backfill views).
//!
//! # Async Handling
//!
//! All application interaction occurs asynchronously, meaning that the engine can continue processing messages
//! while a payload is being built or verified (usually take hundreds of milliseconds).
//!
//! # Dedicated Processing for Consensus Messages
//!
//! All peer interaction related to consensus is strictly prioritized over any other messages (i.e. helping new
//! peers sync to the network).
//!
//! # Specification for View `v`
//!
//! _We don't assume that messages are eventually delivered and instead tolerate arbitrary drops._
//!
//! Upon entering view `v`:
//! * Determine leader `l` for view `v`
//! * Set timer for leader proposal `t_l` and advance `t_a`
//!     * If leader `l` has not been active (no votes) in last `r` views, set `t_l` to 0.
//! * If leader, propose container `c` for view `v`
//!
//! Upon receiving first container `c` from `l`:
//! * Cancel `t_l`
//! * If we have `c_parent`, have verified `c_parent`, `c_parent` is notarized (either implicitly or explicitly), and we have null notarizations
//!   for all views between `c_parent` and `c`, then verify `c` and broadcast vote for `c`.
//!
//! Upon receiving `2f+1` votes for `c`:
//! * Cancel `t_a`
//! * Broadcast `c` and notarization for `c`
//! * Notarize `c` at height `h` (and recursively notarize its parents)
//! * If have not broadcast null vote for view `v`, broadcast finalize for `c`
//! * Enter `v+1`
//!
//! Upon receiving `2f+1` null votes for `v`:
//! * Broadcast null notarization for `v`
//! * Enter `v+1`
//! * If observe `>= f+1` votes for some proposal `c` in a view, fetch the non-null notarization for `c_parent` and any missing null notarizations
//!   between `c_parent` and `c`
//!
//! Upon receiving `2f+1` finalizes for `c`:
//! * Broadcast finalization for `c`
//! * Finalize `c` at height `h` (and recursively finalize its parents)
//!
//! Upon `t_l` or `t_a` firing:
//! * Broadcast null vote for view `v`
//! * Every `t_r` after null vote that we are still in view `v`:
//!    * For nodes that have yet to vote null, rebroadcast null vote for view `v` and notarization from `v-1`
//!
//! _For efficiency, `c` is `hash(c)` and it is up to an external mechanism to ensure that the contents of `c` are available to all participants._
//!
//! ## Adapting Simplex to Real-World: Syncing, Restarts, and Dropped Messages
//!
//! * Distinct Leader timeout (in addition to notarization timeout)
//!     * Skip leader timeout/notarization timeout if we haven't seen a participant vote in some number of views
//! * Don't assume that all notarizations are sent with each proposal
//! * Periodically retry building of proposal
//! * [NOT SAFE] Backfill containers from notarizing peers rather than passing along with notarization message
//! * Dynamic sync for new nodes (join consensus at tip right away and backfill history + new containers on-the-fly)/no dedicated
//!   "sync" phase
//! * Only multicast proposal `c` in `v` on transition to `v+1  to peers that haven't already voted for `c`
//! * Only multicast dependent notarizations (notarization for `c_parent` and null notarizations between `c_parent` and `c`) for `v` to peers that
//!   didn't vote for `c`
//!
//! # What is a good fit?
//!
//! * Desire fast block times (as fast as possible): No message relay through leader
//!     * Uptime/Fault tracking (over `n` previous heights instead of waiting for some timeout after notarization for
//!       more votes) -> means there is no wait at the end of a view to collect more votes/finalizes
//! * Proposals are small (include references to application data rather than application data itself): Each notarization may require each party to re-broadcast the proposal
//! * Small to medium number of validators (< 500): All messages are broadcast
//! * Strong robustness against Byzantine leaders? (still can trigger later than desired start to verification) but can't force a fetch
//!     * Saves at least 1 RTT (and more if first recipient doesn't have/is byzantine)
//!     * Minimal ability to impact performance in next view (still can timeout current view)
//!     * No requirement for consecutive honest leaders to commit
//!
//! # Tradeoff: Bandwidth Efficiency or Robustness
//!
//! * This is the difference between broadcasting a proposal to the next leader if they didn't vote for the block and waiting for them
//!   to fetch the block themselves.
//!
//! # Performance Degradation
//!
//! * Ever-growing unfinalized tip: processing views are cached in-memory
//!     * Particularly bad if composed of null notarizations
//!
//! Crazy Idea: What if there is no proposal and the vote/notarization contains all info (only ever include a hash of the proposal)? Would this undermine
//! an application's ability to build a useful product (as wouldn't know contents of block until an arbitrary point in the future, potentially after asked to produce
//! a new block/may also not know parent yet)?
//! * Could leave to the builder to decide whether to wait to produce a block until they've seen finalized parent or not. Would anyone ever want not? Could also
//!   leave constructing/disseminating the block to the builder. We agree on hashes, you can do whatever you want to get to that point?
//! * TL;DR: Agreement isn't Dissemination -> Tension: Agreement is most reliable with all-to-all broadcast but dissemnination is definitely not most efficient that way
//! * Verify returns as soon as get the proposal rather than immediately if don't have it. This will ensure that consensus messages that get to participant before payload
//!   won't just immediately be dropped?
