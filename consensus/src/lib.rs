// Example Payload (Transfers):
// - Vec<Tx> => hashed as balanced binary trie by hash
//
// Context:
// -> Builder, View (gauge of time elapsed), Height, Timestamp, Parent_Payload (used to track inner trie)
// .   -> If previously proposed block at a height that is not yet canonicalized, should re-propose?
// -> (Optional) Signers in previous round (reward uptime)
// -> (Optional) Faults (at any round)
//
// Expectations:
// * Application tracks a trie of pending blocks (with pending state diffs to that trie)
//   * If we only execute committed blocks, this isn't required? Still need to build proposals on a tree of blocks (can't wait for finality
// .   to build). Also would mean data proveable from a block may not be correct (would need to rely on child block to indicate what was successful).
