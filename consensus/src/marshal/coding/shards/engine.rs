//! Shard engine for erasure-coded block distribution and reconstruction.
//!
//! This module implements the core logic for distributing blocks as erasure-coded
//! shards and reconstructing blocks from received shards.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The shard engine serves two primary functions:
//! 1. Broadcast: When a node proposes a block, the engine broadcasts
//!    erasure-coded shards to all participants and to non-participants in
//!    aggregate membership (peers in [`commonware_p2p::PeerSetUpdate::all`]
//!    but not in the epoch participant list).
//!    The leader sends each participant their indexed shard.
//! 2. Block Reconstruction: When a node receives shards from peers, the engine
//!    validates them and reconstructs the original block once enough valid
//!    shards are available. Both participants and non-participants can
//!    reconstruct blocks: participants receive their own indexed shard from
//!    the leader, while non-participants reconstruct from shards gossiped
//!    by participants. All participants gossip their validated shard to peers.

//! # Reconstruction State Machine
//!
//! For each [`Commitment`] with a known leader, nodes (both participants
//! and non-participants) maintain a [`ReconstructionState`]. Before leader
//! announcement, shards are buffered in bounded per-peer queues:
//!
//! ```text
//!    +----------------------+
//!    | AwaitingQuorum       |
//!    | - leader known       |
//!    | - leader's shard     |  <--- verified immediately on receipt

//!    | - other shards       |  <--- buffered in pending_shards

//!
//! _Per-peer buffers are only kept for peers in `latest.primary`, matching [`commonware_broadcast::buffered`].
//! When a peer is no longer in `latest.primary`, all its buffered shards are evicted._
//!
//! # Peer Validation and Blocking Rules
//!
//! The engine enforces strict validation to prevent Byzantine attacks:
//!
//! - All shards MUST be sent by participants in the current epoch.
//! - If the sender is the leader: the shard index MUST match the recipient's
//!   participant index (for participants) or the leader's index (for
//!   non-participants).
//! - If the sender is not the leader: the shard index MUST match the sender's
//!   participant index (each participant can only gossip their own shard).
//! - All shards MUST pass cryptographic verification against the commitment.
//! - Each shard index may only contribute ONE shard per commitment.
//! - Sending a second shard for the same index with different data
//!   (equivocation) results in blocking. Exact duplicates are silently
//!   ignored.
//!
//! Peers violating these rules are blocked via the [`Blocker`] trait.
//! Validation and blocking rules are applied while a commitment is actively
//! tracked in reconstruction state. Once a block is already reconstructed and
//! cached, additional shards for that commitment are ignored.
//!
//! _If the leader is not yet known, shards are buffered in fixed-size per-peer
//! queues until consensus signals the leader via [`Discovered`]. Once leader
//! is known, buffered shards for that commitment are ingested into the active
//! state machine._
//!
