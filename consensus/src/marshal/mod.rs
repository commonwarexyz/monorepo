//! Ordered delivery of finalized blocks.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The core of the module is the unified [`core::Actor`]. It marshals finalized blocks into order by:
//!
//! - Receiving uncertified blocks from a broadcast mechanism
//! - Receiving notarizations and finalizations from consensus
//! - Reconstructing a total order of finalized blocks
//! - Providing a backfill mechanism for missing blocks
//!
//! The actor interacts with several components:
//! - [`crate::Reporter`]: Receives ordered, finalized blocks at-least-once
//! - [`crate::simplex`]: Provides consensus messages
//! - Application: Provides verified blocks
//! - [`commonware_broadcast::buffered`]: Provides uncertified blocks (standard mode)
//! - [`coding::shards::Engine`]: Provides erasure-coded shards (coding mode)
//! - [`resolver`]: Provides a backfill mechanism for missing blocks
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! ## Delivery
//!
//! The actor delivers each finalized block from its starting height onward, in height order and
//! at least once. Installing a floor can skip ahead. A restart or a floor installation can
//! redeliver already reported blocks with fresh acknowledgements, so reporters must handle
//! duplicates.
//!
//! ## Finalization
//!
//! The actor uses a view-based model to track the state of the chain. Each view corresponds
//! to a potential block in the chain. The actor will only finalize a block (and its ancestors)
//! if it has a corresponding finalization from consensus.
//!
//! _It is possible that there may exist multiple finalizations for the same block in different views. Marshal
//! only concerns itself with verifying a valid finalization exists for a block, not that a specific finalization
//! exists. This means different Marshals may have different finalizations for the same block persisted to disk._
//!
//! ## Backfill
//!
//! The actor provides a backfill mechanism for missing blocks. If the actor notices a gap in its
//! knowledge of finalized blocks, it will request the missing blocks from its peers. This ensures
//! that the actor can catch up to the rest of the network if it falls behind.
//!
//! ## Message Sizes
//!
//! Backfill sends a complete block in one resolver response, with a notarization or finalization
//! when the request names a round or height, and the buffer disseminates each block to its
//! committee. The network must carry every such message, since a p2p sender panics on a payload
//! above its [`max_message_size`](commonware_p2p::LimitedSender::max_message_size), and marshal
//! never withholds one: a block it holds is served and forwarded whatever its size.
//!
//! The application chooses the largest encoded application block it allows and keeps every block
//! marshal holds within it: the blocks [`Application::prepare`](crate::Application::prepare) and
//! [`Application::propose`](crate::Application::propose) return, the genesis anchor, every block
//! passed to [`core::Mailbox`], and every block [`Config::block_codec_config`] decodes, since the
//! buffer and backfill hold the blocks they decode before the application verifies them.
//! [`Limits`] gives the largest payloads marshal sends for such blocks and committees of at most a
//! given size: one response carrying a block with the widest notarization, and the block's widest
//! buffer payload for any committee of at most that size, with room for a
//! [`Muxer`](commonware_p2p::utils::mux::Muxer) subchannel prefix.
//!
//! Fold the limits into the backfill network's `max_message_size` with
//! [`commonware_p2p::max_message_size`], wrapped in
//! [`Prefixed`](commonware_p2p::utils::mux::Prefixed) when backfill runs on a subchannel, and set
//! the buffer's own limit, if it has one ([`coding::shards::Config::max_block_size`] for coding),
//! to at least the largest application block. The buffer must send on the backfill network,
//! directly or on one subchannel, so that the fold covers what it sends:
//!
//! - [`commonware_broadcast::buffered`] sends each block whole.
//! - [`coding::shards::Engine`] sends the shards of a block it proposes or forwards, which marshal
//!   codes for the block's committee, and relays the shards it receives, which p2p bounds by the
//!   sender's limit.
//!
//! Nodes that run marshal on one network must allow the same blocks and size the network alike.
//! Across restarts, neither the largest application block nor the backfill sender's
//! `max_message_size` may decrease while stored blocks remain.
//!
//! ## Storage
//!
//! The actor uses a combination of internal and external ([`store::Certificates`], [`store::Blocks`]) storage
//! to store blocks and finalizations. Internal storage (in-memory caches) is used for data that is only
//! needed for a short period of time, such as unverified blocks or notarizations. External storage
//! (archive backends) is used to persist finalized blocks and certificates.
//!
//! Marshal stores finalized blocks from a configurable starting height (or, floor) onward.
//! This allows for state sync from a specific height rather than from genesis. The floor
//! is supplied as a finalization. Marshal obtains the corresponding block asynchronously,
//! from local storage, the buffer, or peers, before dispatching application blocks starting
//! at that height. Installing a floor may prune older history if [`store::Blocks`] supports
//! pruning, but keeps the stored block preceding the floor.
//!
//! _History below the starting height may be unavailable to peers. This feature is only
//! recommended for applications that support state sync and do not require full block history to
//! participate in consensus._
//!
//! ## Limitations and Future Work
//!
//! - Only works with [crate::simplex] rather than general consensus.
//! - Assumes at-most one notarization per view, incompatible with some consensus protocols.
//! - Uses [`broadcast::buffered`](`commonware_broadcast::buffered`) for broadcasting and receiving
//!   uncertified blocks from the network.
