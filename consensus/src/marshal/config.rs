/// Any height marshal is asked to sync must be covered by both the
/// [epocher](Self::epocher) and the [provider](Self::provider). If
/// either returns `None` for a requested height, resolved requests will
/// be acknowledged and then dropped. If no longer needed (say a duplicate request
/// for a height we've long since processed), this drop is harmless. However, failing
/// to provide either the epocher or the provider for a height we still require to
/// process the canonical chain will lead marshal to stall (acknowledged requests
/// may not be retried).
///
/// ## Safe Pruning
///
/// Applications may prune epocher/provider entries once the last processed
/// height passes a prune target. The last processed height can be
/// derived from an `Update::Block` at height `H` as
/// `H - max_pending_acks` (the maximum backlog of blocks the application can buffer).
