//! Standard variant for Marshal.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The standard variant broadcasts complete blocks to all peers. Each validator
//! receives the full block directly from the proposer or via gossip.
//!
//! # Components
//!
//! - [`Standard`]: The variant marker type that configures marshal for full-block broadcast.
//! - [`Marshaled`]: Wraps an [`crate::Application`] implementation to enforce epoch boundaries
//!   and coordinate with the marshal actor.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The standard variant uses the core [`crate::marshal::core::Actor`] and
//! [`crate::marshal::core::Mailbox`] with [`Standard`] as the variant type parameter.
//! Blocks are broadcast through [`commonware_broadcast::buffered`].
//!
//! # When to Use
//!
//! Prefer this variant when block sizes are small enough that shipping full blocks
//! to every peer is acceptable.
