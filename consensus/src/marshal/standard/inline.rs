//! Wrapper for standard marshal with inline verification.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! [`Inline`] adapts any [`Application`] to the marshal/consensus interfaces
//! while keeping block validation in the [`Automaton::verify`] path. Unlike
//! [`super::Deferred`], it does not defer application verification to certification.
//! Instead, it only reports `true` from `verify` after parent/height checks and
//! application verification complete.
//!
//! # Epoch Boundaries
//!
//! As with [`super::Deferred`], when the parent is the last block of the epoch,
//! [`Inline`] re-proposes that boundary block instead of building a new block.
//! This prevents proposing blocks that would be excluded by epoch transition.
//!
//! # Verification Model
//!
//! Inline mode intentionally avoids relying on embedded block context. This allows
//! usage with block types that implement [`crate::Block`] but not
//! [`crate::CertifiableBlock`].
//!
//! Because verification is completed inline, `certify` must only wait for data
//! availability in marshal. No additional deferred verification state needs to
//! be awaited at certify time.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let application = Inline::new(
//!     context,
//!     my_application,
//!     marshal_mailbox,
//!     epocher,
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! # When to Use
//!
//! Prefer this wrapper when:
//! - Your application block type is not certifiable.
//! - You prefer simpler verification semantics over deferred verification latency hiding.
//! - You are willing to perform full application verification before casting a notarize vote.
