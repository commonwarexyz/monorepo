//! Wrapper for consensus applications that handles epochs and block dissemination.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! [`Deferred`] is an adapter that wraps any [`Application`] implementation to handle
//! epoch transitions automatically. It intercepts consensus operations (propose, verify) and
//! ensures blocks are only produced within valid epoch boundaries.
//!
//! # Epoch Boundaries
//!
//! When the parent is the last block in an epoch (as determined by the [`Epocher`]), this wrapper
//! re-proposes that boundary block instead of building a new block. This avoids producing blocks
//! that would be pruned by the epoch transition.
//!
//! # Deferred Verification
//!
//! Before casting a notarize vote, [`Deferred`] waits for the block to become available and
//! then verifies that the block's embedded context matches the consensus context. However, it does not
//! wait for the application to finish verifying the block contents before voting. This enables verification
//! to run while we wait for a quorum of votes to form a certificate (hiding verification latency behind network
//! latency). Once a certificate is formed, we wait on the verification result in [`CertifiableAutomaton::certify`]
//! before voting to finalize (ensuring no invalid blocks are admitted to the canonical chain).
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Wrap your [`Application`] implementation with [`Deferred::new`] and provide it to your
//! consensus engine for the [`Automaton`] and [`Relay`]. The wrapper handles all epoch logic transparently.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let application = Deferred::new(
//!     context,
//!     my_application,
//!     marshal_mailbox,
//!     epocher,
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! # Implementation Notes
//!
//! - Genesis blocks are handled specially: epoch 0 returns the application's genesis block,
//!   while subsequent epochs use the last block of the previous epoch as genesis
//! - Blocks are automatically verified to be within the current epoch
//!
//! # Notarization and Data Availability
//!
//! In rare crash cases, it is possible for a notarization certificate to exist without a block being
//! available to the honest parties if [`CertifiableAutomaton::certify`] fails after a notarization is
//! formed.
//!
//! For this reason, it should not be expected that every notarized payload will be certifiable due
//! to the lack of an available block. However, if even one honest and online party has the block,
//! they will attempt to forward it to others via marshal's resolver.
//!
//! ```text
//!                                      ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
//!                                      ▼                                                   │
//! ┌─────────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────────┐
//! │          B1         │◀──│          B2         │◀──│          B3         │XXX│          B4         │
//! └─────────────────────┘   └─────────────────────┘   └──────────┬──────────┘   └─────────────────────┘
//!                                                                │
//!                                                          Failed Certify
//! ```
//!
//! # Future Work
//!
//! - To further reduce view latency, a participant could optimistically vote for a block prior to
//!   observing its availability during [`Automaton::verify`]. However, this would require updating
//!   other components (like [`crate::marshal`]) to handle backfill where notarization does not imply
//!   a block is fetchable (without modification, a malicious leader that withholds blocks during propose
//!   could get an honest node to exhaust their network rate limit fetching things that don't exist rather
//!   than blocks they need AND can fetch).

/// An [`Application`] adapter that handles epoch transitions and validates block ancestry.
///
/// This wrapper intercepts consensus operations to enforce epoch boundaries and validate
/// block ancestry. It prevents blocks from being produced outside their valid epoch,
/// handles the special case of re-proposing boundary blocks at epoch boundaries,
/// and ensures all blocks have valid parent linkage and contiguous heights.
///
/// # Ancestry Validation
///
/// Applications wrapped by [`Deferred`] can rely on the following ancestry checks being
/// performed automatically during verification:
/// - Parent digest matches the consensus context's expected parent
/// - Block height is exactly one greater than the parent's height
///
/// Verifying only the immediate parent is sufficient since the parent itself must have
/// been notarized by consensus, which guarantees it was verified and accepted by a quorum.
/// This means the entire ancestry chain back to genesis is transitively validated.
///
/// Applications do not need to re-implement these checks in their own verification logic.
///
/// # Context Recovery
///
/// With deferred verification, validators wait for data availability (DA) and verify the context
/// before voting. If a validator crashes after voting but before certification, they lose their in-memory
/// certification gate task. When recovering, validators extract context from a [`CertifiableBlock`].
///
/// _This embedded context is trustworthy because the notarizing quorum (which contains at least f+1 honest
/// validators) verified that the block's context matched the consensus context before voting._
