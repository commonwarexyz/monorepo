//! Epoch management wrapper for consensus applications.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! [EpochedApplication] is an adapter that wraps any [VerifyingApplication] implementation to handle
//! epoch transitions automatically. It intercepts consensus operations (propose, verify) and
//! ensures blocks are only produced within valid epoch boundaries.
//!
//! # Epoch Boundaries
//!
//! An epoch is a fixed number of blocks (the `epoch_length`). When the last block in an epoch
//! is reached, this wrapper prevents new blocks from being built & proposed until the next epoch begins.
//! Instead, it re-proposes the boundary block to avoid producing blocks that would be pruned
//! by the epoch transition.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Wrap your application implementation with [EpochedApplication::new] and provide it to your
//! consensus engine for the [Automaton] and [Relay]. The wrapper handles all epoch logic transparently.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let application = EpochedApplication::new(
//!     context,
//!     my_application,
//!     marshal_mailbox,
//!     BLOCKS_PER_EPOCH,
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! # Implementation Notes
//!
//! - Genesis blocks are handled specially: epoch 0 returns the application's genesis block,
//!   while subsequent epochs use the last block of the previous epoch as genesis
//! - Blocks are automatically verified to be within the current epoch
